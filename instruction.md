Instructions

    Add Express to this node.js project
    create a server with an endpoint that directs to /api.
    Run your server and use the button below to open the browser. You can test your endpoint by adding /api to the end of the page url.
    Once the server is working, stop it with CTRL-c. Compile the TypeScript using the build script and run the server from your build script. Test that the endpoint still works.
